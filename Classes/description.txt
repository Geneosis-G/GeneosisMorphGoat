They told me I could be anything... So I became everything!

The art of disguise is not easy to master, but some goats like you are exceptional and can take the form of any object they find!

[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]Since I published the Ghost Goat mod, a lot of people suggested to make it possible to control random objects too. As I explained to them it was not possible using the method I use for the Ghost Goat, anyway I kept this idea in mind and ended up with another solution that will work only for objects (and not for living creatures) and here it is ^^
So this mod don't really change the form of your goat, it simply attach the object you are licking to your body and makes your body invisible. I just had to add some location and rotation corrections to make the controlled object oriented correctly :)
